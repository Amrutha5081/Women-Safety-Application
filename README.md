# Women-Safety-Application
Safety for women has become a major issue as the day-by-day cases increasing all 
over the world. This proposed project explains women's safety and their security by 
using an application to send alert messages, showing safe locations & alert 
authorities.

In this project, an android based smartphone with an integrated feature that alerts 
and provides location-based information. It provides self-defence and SMS alerts
when a woman is in danger. The voice recognition will happen when the woman is 
shouting. It will recognize the voice and send the alert message to the contact and 
send alert SMS with (GPS) Global positioning system location to emergency contacts.
